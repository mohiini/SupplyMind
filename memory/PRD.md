# SupplyMind: Agentic AI Operating System for Supply Chain Intelligence

## Original Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive university project that demonstrates AI-First OS thinking, Agentic AI architecture, and multi-agent orchestration for supply chain intelligence. The system must satisfy two university assignments simultaneously - AI-First Operating System Capstone and Architecting & Deploying LLM/Agentic AI Systems.

## User Choices
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama Llama3 (offline/local model)
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Deliverables**: Report and Slides generation included
- **Theme**: Dark tech aesthetic

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Shadcn UI, Recharts, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: FastAPI with MongoDB
- **LLM**: Ollama Llama3 (with mock fallback when unavailable)
- **Multi-Agent System**: 5 specialized agents communicating via message bus

## Core Requirements (Static)
1. Multi-agent architecture with Orchestrator, Demand, Inventory, Supplier, and Action agents
2. 10 supply chain workflows with deep dive analysis
3. Supplier risk detection demo with LLM reasoning
4. Report and slides generation for academic deliverables
5. Real-time agent status visualization
6. Analytics dashboard with KPIs, charts, and ROI analysis

## User Personas
- University students presenting capstone projects
- Professors evaluating AI/ML systems
- Supply chain professionals exploring AI solutions
- Startup founders seeking supply chain innovation

## What's Been Implemented (March 2026)

### Backend (FastAPI)
- ✅ Multi-agent system with 5 agents (Orchestrator, Demand, Inventory, Supplier, Action)
- ✅ Agent message bus for inter-agent communication
- ✅ State-wise validation layer for all operations
- ✅ LLM output validation
- ✅ 10 supply chain workflows with metadata
- ✅ Supplier risk analysis endpoint with LLM integration
- ✅ Orchestrator task processing
- ✅ Report and slides content APIs
- ✅ Analytics data endpoints (demand trends, inventory, suppliers, costs)
- ✅ KPI metrics endpoints
- ✅ Ollama Llama3 integration with mock fallback

### Frontend (React)
- ✅ Dark tech aesthetic dashboard
- ✅ Agent status bar showing all 5 agents
- ✅ KPI cards with trend indicators
- ✅ Interactive charts (demand, inventory, suppliers)
- ✅ Workflows page with 10 workflows and detail panel
- ✅ Agents page with network visualization and message bus
- ✅ Analytics page with tabs (Overview, Suppliers, Costs, ROI)
- ✅ Reports page with collapsible sections and slides viewer
- ✅ Supplier Risk Demo with step-by-step analysis animation
- ✅ Report and slides download functionality

## Prioritized Backlog

### P0 (Critical) - ✅ COMPLETED
- Multi-agent architecture
- Core workflows
- Supplier risk demo
- Dashboard with KPIs
- Report generation

### P1 (High Priority) - Future
- Actual Ollama Llama3 deployment
- Real-time data streaming
- Persistent agent conversation history
- PDF generation for reports/slides

### P2 (Medium Priority) - Future
- User authentication
- Historical decision audit trail
- Webhook integrations
- Custom workflow creation

### P3 (Low Priority) - Future
- Mobile responsive optimization
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Export to various formats
- API rate limiting

## Next Tasks
1. Deploy Ollama locally for actual LLM inference
2. Add PDF export for reports and slides
3. Implement persistent agent memory
4. Add real-time WebSocket updates for agent status
5. Create user onboarding flow

## Technical Notes
- Ollama Llama3 falls back to mock responses when not available locally
- All backend routes prefixed with /api
- MongoDB used for storing analysis results and task history
- Frontend uses process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL for API calls
